# Get Started

## What we are going to cover
This course is BASICs for hosting a simple home server with the Raspberry Pi 4B. We will use **_docker_** and **_portainer_**. We will use **_docker_** to create a **_portainer_** instance. We will also cover as a STRETCH how to set up **_VMWare EXSI ARM Fling_**.

## Requirements
_**NOTE:** all of this and more is in the CanaKit which you can buy for about 100 US $/Â£100_

* Raspberry Pi 4
    * Model B
    * 4GB or more ram
* Micro SD Card
    * 64GB/32GB
    * You could use a external drive like a SSD or hard drive to increase boot and download speeds, but you won't really need it.
* Case (optional)
* Power supply 
    * USB-C
    * PLEASE DON'T USE A ACTUAL PHONE CHARGER. IT DOESN'T GIVE VERRY MUCH POWER AND YOU WILL PROBABLY BREAK THE CHARGER. JUST BUY THE RASPBERRY PI ONE FROM THE PI FOUNDATION. PLEEEEASE!

And that's it! Order everything and start at [Pt. 1](https://linux-with-raspberrypi.github.com/part-one)
